BAYER 21820,All solid tumours,advanced ,"First-in-human dose-escalation and expansion study of the anti-CCR8 antibody BAY 3375968 in combination with pembrolizumab to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics in participants with selected advanced solid tumors",NCT05537740,,"Researchers are looking for a better way to treat people who have advanced solid tumors. Advanced solid tumors are solid cancers that may have spread to nearby tissue, lymph nodes and/or to distant parts of the body and that are unlikely to be cured or controlled with currently available treatments.

A new therapy available for advanced solid cancers is immunotherapy with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. This drug class stimulates immune cells to kill cancer cells by blocking a protein called PD-1. Although PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors have shown benefits in treatment of cancer, only a subset of patients benefit from the initial therapy, while in others the cancer comes back. One reason could be that the ability of the patients' immune systems to kill cancer cells is weakened by so-called regulatory T cells which have a suppressive effect on the immune system.

The study treatment BAY3375968 is an antibody that binds to a protein called CCR8 which is located on the surface of regulatory T cells. This leads to a reduction in regulatory T cells and further inhibits their immune suppressive activity, so that the immune response against cancer can be strengthened as observed in animal models. Animal studies also showed that BAY3375968 may add more anti-cancer effect to immunotherapy with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors when used in combination. All of these previous observations need to be confirmed in humans.

The main aims of this study are to find for BAY3375968 alone and in combination with pembrolizumab (a PD-1 inhibitor):

* how safe it is
* the degree to which overt medical problems caused by the treatment(s) can be tolerated
* the highest amount of BAY3375968 that can be given alone or in combination with pembrolizumab.
* how it moves into, through, and out of the body.

To do this, researchers will collect and analyze data about:

* the number and severity of participants' medical problems after taking their treatments
* the best dose of BAY3375968 that can be given
* the highest level in the blood (Cmax) and the total level (AUC) of BAY3375968.

Doctors keep track of all medical problems (also called adverse events) that participants have during the study, even if they do not think that they might be related to the study treatment.

The researchers will also study the activity of BAY3375968 alone and in combination with pembrolizumab against the cancer.

The study will have 2 parts. Part 1 (dose escalation) focuses on tumor types that respond to immunotherapy. It will help to find the best dose for BAY3375968 alone and in combination with pembrolizumab that can be given in part 2. For this, the participants will receive one specific dose of several increasing BAY3375968 doses tested in part 1. Dose escalation of BAY3375968 alone will be done prior to the dose escalation of the combination with a fixed dose of pembrolizumab.

The participants of part 2 (dose expansion), will receive the best dose of BAY3375968 alone or in combination with pembrolizumab found in part 1. This part of the study focuses on certain cancer types of the lung, breast, head and neck cancer, gastric cancer and melanoma.

The total duration of the study will be approximately 4 years and 7 months. Each participant in the study will visit the study site twice before starting their treatment. Once the treatment starts, the frequency of visits is 5 times per week in the first treatment week and 1 to 3 times per month in later treatment periods. Another visit will be scheduled for the participants within 30 days after the last treatment in the study.

During the study, the study team will:

* take blood and urine samples
* do physical and vital signs examinations
* examine heart health using ECG and Echocardiogram
* check the tumor status and if the participants' cancer has grown and/or spread using imaging techniques
* take tumor samples
* ask questions about the impact of the disease on the participants' general well-being and activities of daily life.

About 90 days after the participants receive their last treatment and discontinued the study, the doctors will check the participants' health. In case a new anticancer therapy has been started, medical problems will be recorded via a phone call.

The study team will continue to check the participants' cancer status about every 12 weeks until their cancer gets worse, the start of a new anti-cancer therapy, or withdrawal of consent. In addition, every 6 months for up to 24 months after the last participant left the study the study team will check the participants' survival and subsequent anticancer treatment by phone until the end of this study.","Inclusion Criteria:

ELEVATE,Breast,Mets ER+PR+,"A Phase II randomized trial of Endocrine therapy Letrozole and Lenvatinib versus Fulvestrant in Metastatic Estrogen Receptor positive, HER2 negative breast cancer, who have progressed on CDK4/6 inhibitors",NCT05181033,,"Based on the results of the phase Ib/II study, the investigators hypothesize that combining a RET inhibitor lenvatinib with endocrine therapy letrozole improves objective response and progression-free survival compared to fulvestrant alone in the second line setting in patients who have progressed on first line endocrine therapy incorporating a CDK4/6 inhibitor.

Letrozole and fulvestrant are anti-hormonal drugs that have been proven to have activity and are considered standard therapies for hormone receptor positive breast cancer. The purpose of this study is to determine if the combination therapy of letrozole (an anti-hormonal drug) and lenvatinib (a targeted therapy), when compared to another anti-hormonal drug fulvestrant, is effective in patients with hormone receptor positive breast cancer.

Preliminary studies have shown that approximately 50-60% of hormone receptor positive breast cancers over-express RET, and may therefore respond to treatment by a drug that blocks the RET pathway. An earlier study conducted at the National University Cancer Institute, Singapore (NCIS) on the combination of letrozole and Lenvatinib has shown promising results. Among patients in whom hormonal therapy and a CDK4/6 inhibitor no longer worked, about one-quarter of patients had meaningful disease control. The study also showed that patients tolerated the combination of Lenvatinib and letrozole well with manageable side effects.

Based on the promising findings from the earlier study, this study seeks to compare the effectiveness of lenvatinib plus letrozole with another standard anti-hormone treatment drug called fulvestrant.

In addition, investigators are studying how body reacts to the treatment as well as studying gene and protein changes in the tumour in response to treatment, which may in the future, help us tailor drug treatment for individual patients according to the patient's and/or the tumour's genetic or protein make-up.","Inclusion Criteria:

AHCC12,​Liver / GI,Resectable HCC (high risk of recurrence),"Deep, Multi-omics Phenotyping to Predict Response, Resistance and Recurrence to Adjuvant Atezolizumab plus Bevacizumab in Resected Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)",NCT05516628,,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the 7th most common cancer worldwide but is the 4th deadliest, because diagnosis tend to be late and current systemic therapies are poorly efficacious. Within the same tumour, different parts of the HCC can belong to separate molecular sub-groups. In addition, there is currently no validated predictive biomarkers to help clinicians select the best therapy for an individual patient. This challenge poses an urgent, unmet clinical need.

To address this, the multi-disciplinary research program Precision Medicine in Liver Cancer across an Asia-Pacific Network (PLANet 1.0) was conceptualized and successfully conducted from 2016-22. The program uncovered novel insights into the highly heterogeneous molecular landscape of HCC and novel mechanisms, including how HCC reverts to fetal forms to escape the body's immunological defence.

These investigations will be continued in PLANet 2.0 and in this new phase, the research team will investigate patients receiving best-in-class therapeutics in 2 investigator-initiated clinical studies (AHCC12 and AHCC13), including Atezolizumab plus Bevacizumab (Atezo+Bev) and Yttrium-90, which allows the research team to collect longitudinal, before and after treatment biosamples and clinical data. These clinical studies will serve as proof-of-concept to the study team's translational findings and allow it to uncover predictive biomarkers which will help clinicians to institute more efficacious and personalized treatment in the future. The research team comprises of experts in different complementary fields (epigenomics, genomics, immunomics, metabolomics, proteomics, clinical science and data science) and across different institutions. This allows the team to adopt an integrative approach in understanding the landscape of the HCC tumour micro-environment and biomarkers co-localisation, and their role in tumour evolution and therapeutic response. By adopting a wide spectrum of converging investigations, PLANet 2.0 will identify and validate biomarkers that correlate with clinical outcomes (response, resistance and recurrence).","Inclusion Criteria:

People can join the study if they have tumours with HER2 mutations and have not yet received any systemic therapy including chemotherapy for advanced or metastatic lung cancer. The purpose of this study is to find out whether a medicine called zongertinib (BI 1810631) can slow down the worsening of advanced non-small cell lung cancer better than the standard treatment available. Zongertinib may slow cancer cell growth by inhibiting HER2. This would prolong cancer re-occurrence and increase survival. Current standard treatment is pembrolizumab plus platinum-pemetrexed chemotherapy.

Participants are put into 2 groups by chance. One group receives zongertinib at regular times throughout the study and the other group receives infusions of pembrolizumab, pemetrexed and cisplatin or carboplatin (pembrolizumab plus platinum-pemetrexed chemotherapy) into a vein.

Participants may be in the study up to a maximum of 70 months. During this time, they visit the study site about every 3 weeks for study procedures. The doctors regularly check the size of the tumour with a CT or MRI scan, at the beginning of the study and every 6 weeks. After 18 months they check the tumour size every 12 weeks. Doctors regularly check whether the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. The doctors also regularly check participants' health and take note of any unwanted effects. The time it takes for the cancer to worsen is compared between the 2 groups to see whether the treatment works. The participants also fill in questionnaires about their symptoms and quality of life.","Inclusion criteria:

Two different readers will be involved, one reader for PSMA PET scan and one reader for CI: Reader will be blinded to PSMA PET scan results while reading CI scans. Reader should not modify their assessment of CI scans (e.g. changing a lesion previously identified as equivocal in CI to unequivocal) after reading the PSMA PET scan. Similarly, biopsy positivity should not influence the reader in the assessment of CI positivity. More details on the reading paradigm will be provided in the imaging charter
